# Neural network model to predict mutation outcome (Master's Thesis)

Repo for my Master's thesis titled "Developing a Deep Learning Model to Predict Mutation Probabilities at Single Base Resolution".

Project structure:

- data folder: stores data at various stages of the data pipeline
- results folder: stores results (log files, figures, saved models, etc.)
- scripts folder: stores bash scripts for submitting Python files that train or evaluate certain models
- src folder: stores Python files for training and evaluating models
- src/utils folder: stores small utility scripts
